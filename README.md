# Graphical-Authentication-User-System-Experience (GAUSX)

This innovative web-based authentication system offers users the option to create a more secure login process by utilizing a combination of graphical and text-based passwords. Studies have indicated that people tend to remember images more effectively than text, and traditional text passwords are susceptible to hacking. By allowing users to select specific images and grid points to use as their graphical passwords, this system aims to provide a higher level of security compared to standard text passwords.
